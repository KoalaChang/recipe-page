## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I use Tailwind CSS in this project for the first time, though I'm still not familiar with the workflow and the way to use it, I can tell that it would be easier to build consistent styles and layouts with Tailwind.

### Continued development

I would like to combine the use of Tailwind and React, and see how components can work efficiently with these two frameworks.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Labs - From Zero to Production](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5f_mz_zU5eXWYDXHUDOLBE0scnuJofO0) - This helped me for starting a Tailwind project, and icludes some classic method to implement styles with Tailwind.
- [Tailwind CSS - Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This is the official documentation of Tailwind, which includes the properties comparison between Tailwind and primary CSS.
